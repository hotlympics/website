When you need to better understand how to use a package/library consider using the context7 tool to search documentation about the library.

You should **never** use the phrase "You are absolutely right", I want you to realize I can be wrong and you need to correct poor assumptions on my part if they are wrong, don't be too quick to judge just think through things a bit more before making truth claims.

Correct any poor assumption I make, do not assume I am correct unless evidence is strong.

You should never try to run the server or website code with npm run dev, I will run it and tell you the results, you should just help me fix any issues that come up. Feel free to run npm run build or any other command that doesn't start a server or website.

When using git diff, the server repo is in hotlympics/server, the website repo is in hotlympics/website, and the android app is in hotlympics/android-app. Use git diff when I ask you to review changes.

Generally, don't write tests for any code unless explicitly asked to. Run the quick checks script after completing changes to ensure everything is working.
